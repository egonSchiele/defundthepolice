### A Quick Recap Of the Minnesota Budget Cycle

The Minnesota budget operates on a two-year cycle. We're currently in this cycle:

In the middle of this budget cycle, we are going to start planning for the *next* budget cycle (July 1 2021 to June 30 2023). *This* is where we can make impact -- by drastically reducing the police budget for the next budget cycle.

Budget planning for the next cycle is going to start soon. First, all the agencies will come up with a proposed budget:

(MMB = Minnesota Management and Budget).

Then the MMB commissioner sends a budget number to the Ways and Means committee:

The MMB number is just "this is how much money you have, this is what is already spent (like pension costs)".

This information is used as the basis for the *governor's proposed budget for the next cycle*. The ways and means committee does the legal work to see what can be done and what can't be done.

The governor sends his proposed budget to the Minnesota legislature:

The detailed operating budget needs to be sent by Tim Walz by *Jan 26 2021* ([more info](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/16A.11)).

Now the legislature gets to add and remove things from this budget.

Budget proposals are introduced in the Legislature and make their way through the legislative process:

Eventually each bill gets sent to the governor, where he can veto it or sign it into law:

So the governor proposes budget, and the legislature gets to add things and take things out. This is happening in parallel in the house and senate. Then they need to reconcile the budget! And with a democrat-controlled house and republican-controlled senate, that is no easy matter.

Both the governor and house and senate have multiple chances to change the budget. But they all need to agree on something eventually.

### What You Can Do

Call your governor and the people in your legislature and tell them you want to see a drastic REDUCTION in the budget for the police department.

Here's the [Saint Paul Police Department budget summary](https://www.stpaul.gov/sites/default/files/Media%20Root/Financial%20Services/2020%20Adopted%20Police.pdf).

The 2020 budget was almost $126 million.

Minnesota overall budget process:
https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/guides/guides?issue=budget

The biennial budget cycle begins on July 1 of odd-numbered years.
The process of creating a new state budget begins in even-numbered years.

. The commissioner of Minnesota Management & Budget prepares and distributes budget instructions and forms to all state agencies, as specified in Minnesota Statutes 16A.10. Each agency's proposed budget must show actual expenditures and receipts for the two most recent fiscal years, estimated expenditures and receipts for the current fiscal year, and estimates for each fiscal year of the next biennium. This information must be filed with the commissioner by October 15 of each even-numbered year. By November 30 the commissioner must send final budget information to legislative Ways and Means and/or Finance Committees. This information is used as the basis for the governor's proposed biennial budget.




Minnesota Statutes 16A.11 requires the governor to submit a three-part budget to the Minnesota Legislature. Part one is a budget message, part two a detailed operating budget, and part three a capital expenditures budget. Parts one and two are presented to the legislature in January or February of odd-numbered years and part three is presented to the legislature in January of even-numbered years.
