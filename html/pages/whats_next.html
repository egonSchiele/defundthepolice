## What's Next

Some possible next steps are:

*Call your representative*. If a state rep gets 50 calls in a single day, that is really unusual and will have a definite impact. Say something like "I voted for you and I want to see you doing X" (voting for a bill that reduces police spending, introducing a bill, etc).

*Donate to an organization*. Often folks on the legislature won't write their own bills but will introduce a bill written by an organization that has some pull with this person. It's generally better to find existing organizations and support them instead of going it alone.

*Read more*. [You can hear from someone who has done a lot more research on police forces](https://policescorecard.org).

Of course, there's a lot more that can be done. The state of Minnesota is suing the Minneapolis Police Department. The Minneapolis School Board is voting on whether to cut their contract with the MPD. Reclaim The Block is keeping track of which representatives got campaign contributions from police departments, and who is donating those contributions.

There's a lot that can be done, and you can make your voice heard. [Here's a doc with a lot more ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KTBHcXuAUoa-ZevN1-Jq6LYpkmJWhwiJRBhLKRTU0AU/edit).
