One of my embarrassing secrets is I have a very poor knowledge of civics. So over the last week I've been donating money, and wondering what else I can do, but with no understanding of the system I need to work with.

Luckily for me, I'm married to a city planner and thus know a lot of people who *do* know about how our government works. With their help I've created this illustrated guide.

[Body cams and police trainings are not effective in reducing police violence](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1). What works is taking away their money -- defunding the police.

To do this we need to work with the budget system. I've put together an illustrated guide to the Minnesota and Minneapolis budget system.

I learned a lot while writing this and I hope you get something out of reading it!

Some possible next steps are:

- donate to an organization that has influence with someone on the Minnesota legislature and will introduce a bill.

- campaign contributions
